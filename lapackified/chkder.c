/*
 *     Subroutine chkder 
 *
 *     This subroutine checks the gradients of m nonlinear functions 
 *     in n variables, evaluated at a point x, for consistency with 
 *     the functions themselves.  The user must call chkder twice, 
 *     first with mode = 1 and then with mode = 2. 
 *
 *     mode = 1. On input, x must contain the point of evaluation. 
 *               On output, xp is set to a neighboring point. 
 *
 *     mode = 2. On input, fvec must contain the functions and the 
 *                         rows of fjac must contain the gradients 
 *                         of the respective functions each evaluated 
 *                         at x, and fvecp must contain the functions 
 *                         evaluated at xp. 
 *               On output, err contains measures of correctness of 
 *                          the respective gradients. 
 *
 *     The subroutine does not perform reliably if cancellation or 
 *     rounding errors cause a severe loss of significance in the 
 *     evaluation of a function.  Therefore, none of the components 
 *     of x should be unusually small (in particular, zero) or any 
 *     other value which may cause loss of significance. 
 *
 *     The subroutine statement is 
 *
 *       subroutine chkder(m,n,x,fvec,fjac,ldfjac,xp,fvecp,mode,err) 
 *
 *     where 
 *
 *       m is a positive int input variable set to the number 
 *         of functions. 
 *
 *       n is a positive int input variable set to the number 
 *         of variables. 
 *
 *       x is an input array of length n. 
 *
 *       fvec is an array of length m.  On input when mode = 2, 
 *         fvec must contain the functions evaluated at x. 
 *
 *       fjac is an m by n array.  On input when mode = 2, 
 *         the rows of fjac must contain the gradients of 
 *         the respective functions evaluated at x. 
 *
 *       ldfjac is a positive int input parameter not less than m 
 *         which specifies the leading dimension of the array fjac. 
 *
 *       xp is an array of length n.  On output when mode = 1, 
 *         xp is set to a neighboring point of x. 
 *
 *       fvecp is an array of length m.  On input when mode = 2, 
 *         fvecp must contain the functions evaluated at xp. 
 *
 *       mode is an int input variable set to 1 on the first call 
 *         and 2 on the second.  Other values of mode are equivalent 
 *         to mode = 1. 
 *
 *       err is an array of length m.  On output when mode = 2, 
 *         err contains measures of correctness of the respective 
 *         gradients.  If there is no severe loss of significance, 
 *         then if err(i) is 1.0 the i-th gradient is correct, 
 *         while if err(i) is 0.0 the i-th gradient is incorrect. 
 *         For values of err between 0.0 and 1.0, the categorization 
 *         is less certain.  In general, a value of err(i) greater 
 *         than 0.5 indicates that the i-th gradient is probably 
 *         correct, while a value of err(i) less than 0.5 indicates 
 *         that the i-th gradient is probably incorrect.
