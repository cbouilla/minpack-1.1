/*
 *     subroutine qrsolv 
 *
 *     given an m by n matrix A, an n by n diagonal matrix D, 
 *     and an m-vector b, the problem is to determine an x which 
 *     solves the system 
 *
 *           A*x = b ,     D*x = 0, 
 *
 *     in the least squares sense. 
 *
 *     this subroutine completes the solution of the problem 
 *     if it is provided with the necessary information from the 
 *     QR factorization, with column pivoting, of A.  That is, if 
 *     A*P = Q*R, where P is a permutation matrix, Q has orthogonal 
 *     columns, and R is an upper triangular matrix with diagonal 
 *     elements of nonincreasing magnitude, then qrsolv expects 
 *     the full upper triangle of R, the permutation matrix P, 
 *     and the first n components of (Q transpose)*b.  The system 
 *     A*x = b, D*x = 0, is then equivalent to 
 *
 *                  t       t 
 *           R*z = Q *b ,  P *D*P*z = 0 , 
 *
 *     where x = P*z.  If this system does not have full rank, 
 *     then a least squares solution is obtained.  On output qrsolv 
 *     also provides an upper triangular matrix  such that 
 *
 *            t   t               t 
 *           P *(A *A + D*D)*P = S *S. 
 *
 *     S is computed within qrsolv and may be of separate interest. 
 *
 *     the subroutine statement is 
 *
 *       subroutine qrsolv(n,r,ldr,ipvt,diag,qtb,x,sdiag,wa) 
 *
 *     where 
 *
 *       n is a positive integer input variable set to the order of R. 
 *
 *       R is an n by n array.  On input the full upper triangle 
 *         must contain the full upper triangle of the matrix R. 
 *         On output the full upper triangle is unaltered, and the 
 *         strict lower triangle contains the strict upper triangle 
 *         (transposed) of the upper triangular matrix S. 
 *
 *       ldr is a positive integer input variable not less than n 
 *         which specifies the leading dimension of the array R. 
 *
 *       ipvt is an integer input array of length n which defines the 
 *         permutation matrix P such that A*P = Q*T.  Column j of P 
 *         is column ipvt(j) of the identity matrix. 
 *
 *       diag is an input array of length n which must contain the 
 *         diagonal elements of the matrix D. 
 *
 *       qtb is an input array of length n which must contain the first 
 *         n elements of the vector (Q transpose)*b. 
 *
 *       x is an output array of length n which contains the least 
 *         squares solution of the system A*x = b, D*x = 0. 
 *
 *       sdiag is an output array of length n which contains the 
 *         diagonal elements of the upper triangular matrix s. 
 *
 *       wa is a work array of length n.
