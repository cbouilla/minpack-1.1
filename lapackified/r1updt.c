/*
 *     subroutine r1updt 
 *
 *     given an m by n lower trapezoidal matrix S, an m-vector u, 
 *     and an n-vector v, the problem is to determine an 
 *     orthogonal matrix Q such that 
 *
 *                   t 
 *           (S + u*v )*Q
 *
 *     is again lower trapezoidal. 
 *
 *     this subroutine determines Q as the product of 2*(n - 1) 
 *     transformations 
 *
 *           gv(n-1)*...*gv(1)*gw(1)*...*gw(n-1) 
 *
 *     where gv(i), gw(i) are givens rotations in the (i,n) plane 
 *     which eliminate elements in the i-th and n-th planes, 
 *     respectively.  Q itself is not accumulated, rather the 
 *     information to recover the gv, gw rotations is returned. 
 *
 *     the subroutine statement is 
 *
 *       subroutine r1updt(m,n,s,ls,u,v,w,sing) 
 *
 *     where 
 *
 *       m is a positive integer input variable set to the number 
 *         of rows of S. 
 *
 *       n is a positive integer input variable set to the number 
 *         of columns of S.  n must not exceed m. 
 *
 *       S is an array of length ls.  On input S must contain the lower 
 *         trapezoidal matrix S stored by columns.  On output S contains 
 *         the lower trapezoidal matrix produced as described above. 
 *
 *       ls is a positive integer input variable not less than 
 *         (n*(2*m-n+1))/2. 
 *
 *       u is an input array of length m which must contain the 
 *         vector u. 
 *
 *       v is an array of length n.  On input v must contain the vector 
 *         v.  On output v(i) contains the information necessary to 
 *         recover the givens rotation gv(i) described above. 
 *
 *       w is an output array of length m.  w(i) contains information 
 *         necessary to recover the givens rotation gw(i) described 
 *         above. 
 *
 *       sing is a logical output variable.  sing is set true if any 
 *         of the diagonal elements of the output s are zero.  Otherwise 
 *         sing is set false.
