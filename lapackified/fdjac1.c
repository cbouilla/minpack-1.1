/*
 *     subroutine fdjac1 
 *
 *     this subroutine computes a forward-difference approximation 
 *     to the n by n jacobian matrix associated with a specified 
 *     problem of n functions in n variables. if the jacobian has 
 *     a banded form, then function evaluations are saved by only 
 *     approximating the nonzero terms. 
 *
 *     the subroutine statement is 
 *
 *       subroutine fdjac1(fcn,n,x,fvec,fjac,ldfjac,iflag,ml,mu,epsfcn, 
 *                         wa1,wa2) 
 *
 *     where 
 *
 *       fcn is the name of the user-supplied subroutine which 
 *         calculates the functions. fcn must be declared 
 *         in an external statement in the user calling 
 *         program, and should be written as follows. 
 *
 *         subroutine fcn(n,x,fvec,iflag) 
 *         integer n,iflag 
 *         double precision x(n),fvec(n) 
 *         ---------- 
 *         calculate the functions at x and 
 *         return this vector in fvec. 
 *         ---------- 
 *         return 
 *         end 
 *
 *         the value of iflag should not be changed by fcn unless 
 *         the user wants to terminate execution of fdjac1. 
 *         in this case set iflag to a negative integer. 
 *
 *       n is a positive integer input variable set to the number 
 *         of functions and variables. 
 *
 *       x is an input array of length n. 
 *
 *       fvec is an input array of length n which must contain the 
 *         functions evaluated at x. 
 *
 *       fjac is an output n by n array which contains the 
 *         approximation to the jacobian matrix evaluated at x. 
 *
 *       ldfjac is a positive integer input variable not less than n 
 *         which specifies the leading dimension of the array fjac. 
 *
 *       iflag is an integer variable which can be used to terminate 
 *         the execution of fdjac1. see description of fcn. 
 *
 *       ml is a nonnegative integer input variable which specifies 
 *         the number of subdiagonals within the band of the 
 *         jacobian matrix. if the jacobian is not banded, set 
 *         ml to at least n - 1. 
 *
 *       epsfcn is an input variable used in determining a suitable 
 *         step length for the forward-difference approximation. this 
 *         approximation assumes that the relative errors in the 
 *         functions are of the order of epsfcn. if epsfcn is less 
 *         than the machine precision, it is assumed that the relative 
 *         errors in the functions are of the order of the machine 
 *         precision. 
 *
 *       mu is a nonnegative integer input variable which specifies 
 *         the number of superdiagonals within the band of the 
 *         jacobian matrix. if the jacobian is not banded, set 
 *         mu to at least n - 1. 
 *
 *       wa1 and wa2 are work arrays of length n. if ml + mu + 1 is at 
 *         least n, then the jacobian is considered dense, and wa2 is 
 *         not referenced.
